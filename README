- Automatic scoring, per-round and cumulative summaries.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser—no build step or server is required.

## Repository Structure
- `index.html` – main HTML and panel containers  
- `script.js` – game logic, rendering, and interaction handlers  
- `style.css` – styling and layout

## Gameplay Notes
- Bids in a round must not sum to the number of tricks for that round.
- Actuals must sum exactly to the number of tricks.
- Scoring: exact = 10 + tricks; miss = 10 – max(bid, actual).
